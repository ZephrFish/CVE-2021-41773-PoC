# CVE-2021-41773 Proof of Concept
Quick and dirty proof of concept for checking if hosts vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773

```
python3 poc.py hosts.txt
```

Where hosts.txt contains your targets:
```
domain.com
blah.com
192.168.1.1
```

It'll print out if the host is vulnerable or not vulnerable. 




Enjoy!
